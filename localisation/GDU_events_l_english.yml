China won't kill you, but it can make you want to kill yourself. The allies can funnel China industry through the Burma Road, so try to take provinces on the border with the Raj before this grows out of control.  \n 2. Your jobs are to secure the Phillipines, (most important stepping stone) the rubber islands, Singapore, RAJ (if possible), harass allied convoys and navy, and eventually help invade the Soviets. \n 3. My suggested templates for Japan is 40 width light tanks with SPGs, 40 width marines/mountaineers, and 20 width infantry for China and garrison duty. \n 4. You're unlikely to beat the allies industrially, so try to get yourself into a good position in the Pacific and then fortify for their counterattack. \n 5. Heavy fighters and tactical bombers are incredibly useful for Japan, not only as Kamikazes but as ground attack vehicles in the large airzones of Asia. \n 6. If you are good at micro, go left side Grand Battle Plan, if you are not go Superior Firepower. \n Best of luck."

They want to justify the infamous behaviour at the front. But such talk is a falsehood, helpful only to our enemies.\n\nEach commander, Red Army soldier and political commissar should understand that our means are not limitless. The territory of the Soviet state is not a desert, but people - workers, peasants, intelligentsia, our fathers, mothers, wives, brothers, children. The territory of the USSR which the enemy has captured and aims to capture is bread and other products for the army, metal and fuel for industry, factories, plants supplying the army with arms and ammunition, railways. To retreat further - means to waste ourselves and to waste at the same time our Motherland.\n\nTherefore it is necessary to eliminate talk that we have the capability endlessly to retreat, that we have a lot of territory, that our country is great and rich, that there is a large population, and that bread always will be abundant. Such talk is false and parasitic, it weakens us and benefits the enemy, if we do not stop retreating we will be without bread, without fuel, without metal, without raw material, without factories and plants, without railways.\n\nThis leads to the conclusion, it is time to finish retreating. Not one step back!"

When Germany attacks, you'll get an event giving you your 7th doctrine for free, meaning there's no reason to use the technology saving exploit to research ahead of time.\n\nYou'll also get massive doctrine bonuses for your last three doctrines in your tree, so pay attention to those!

Additionally, if you capitulate quickly, Germany will be given additional industry, up to a maximum of 10 civs and 10 mils if you somehow manage to capitulate in less than a week, ranging down to 0 factories for Germany if you can last longer than 10 weeks.\n\nWhen you capitulate, technically you will be automatically switched to a "different" country of Free France (with a different tag of FRF rather than FRA which is done to prevent exploits).\n\n A side effect of this is that you won't be able to succesfully evacuate any units from France (you may as well just try to inflict as many casualties on Germany as you can before you capitulate). However, you will be given equipment, industry, and production efficiency to begin very quickly re-training units as soon as you capitulate, depending on how long you can hold out.\n\nYou will be given PP to re-select advisors and design companies, and will retain all the technologies you researched before capitulation. \n\n IT ALSO IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR FRANCE TO LEND-LEASE BEFORE YOU CAPITULATE (you can do so after, but don't expect your equipment to survive the Fall of France).

Try moving some ships in and out of the English Channel and you will see that this goes up when you move more ships in, and goes down when you move them out of the English Channel. Also look at your national spirits and see that when you have ships in the English Channel, you get a core defense and attack bonus for your troops that is equal to your Sealion Naval Defense Score.\n\nDon't rely on the US navy (or army). The US can't join the allies or get military access or docking rights until you are 50% towards capitulation, or until 1941, and US ships don't count towards your bonus. Home Defense is in your hands, and in particular in the Royal Navy's hands.\n\nIt is recommended that you keep a strong and large home fleet somewhere within easy range of the English Channel at all times. Then, if the Axis Sealions you, move your fleet into the English channel and put up air cover over the Channel to help limit any damage from naval bombing. As long as your navy can beat the Axis fleet and your ships survive, your troops will all get large attack and defense bonuses and you should be able to beat off the invasion.\n\nBut as long as you maintain proper Royal Navy control over the seas, are ready to put sufficient air over the English channel, and keep a sufficiently strong Home Fleet on hand, it should be next to impossible for the Axis to succesfully Sealion you."
