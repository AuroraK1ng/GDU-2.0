guides.1.t:0 "Poisitioning"
guides.1.d:0 "Positioning is a value that directly affects your ships during combat.  It is an element which only can affect your navy negatively if not taken into consideration. It exists on a scale of 0-100%; 100% Being default, and occurs no penalties.  \n \n  In GDU, if you fall to 0% positioning you incur the following debuffs; -70% air attack, -30% screening, -60% naval attack   \n  \n  The most important variable affecting positioning value is your fleet's size in relation to the enemy's. For example, it is set so that when your fleet is ~ 50% larger than the enemy fleet ( 300vs 200 ships) you will not incur any positioning penalties, assuming you have an admiral assigned, - but positioning also changes in real-time- as the battle goes on, due to enemy losses your fleet now becomes 150% larger than the enemy fleet, (example 2 to 5 ship ration, 200 vs 500 ships) you now get the maximum positioning penalty of 100% and have 0 positioning and suffer the maximum penalties.   \n  \n  In conclusion, your positioning will scale between 0%( at 2.5/1.0 and above) and 100%(at 1.5/1.0 ratio and bellow) depending on relative ship ratio. If you'd like to know how we've done this, we've given all admirals +50% base positioning whilst tweaking with positioning values in 00_defines.lua "

guides.2.t:0 "Piercing"
guides.2.d:0 "Piercing is a value which appears whilst in combat against armoured divisions.  If your piercing value exceeds your enemy's armor, your shots against him will hit to full effect.   On the contrary, if you are unable to pierce, your shots will only output 50% damage.   \n \n  In vanilla, a division's piercing value is basicallly 60% of division's average piercing + 40% of battalion with highest piercing - and for armor, it is 70% of division's average armor + 30% of battalion with highest armor  \n  \n  In GDU, we've set this to where your division's piercing is 100% of the battalion with highest piercing!, meaning if you have a HTD in your division, the division's piercing will carry thhe HTD's full piercing.  Be aware, you are not allowed mix non-foot units with foot units. So no putting a HTD battalion in your infantry divisions, unless it's a support company. \n  \n  In GDU, Anti-tank has very high hard attack for it's cost. but will rarely pierce the enemy ,  \n  \n  When you unpenatrable, you suffer 50% less damage - when you are piercable, the enemy deals you extra damage, and a very high amount of extra organization damage.  This means that AT will likely never output much organization damage, and will likely lose combat to tanks, but will still trade favouribly againist tanks in terms of IC. "

guides.3.t:0 "CAS"
guides.3.d:0 "CAS in GDU is a special kind of animal.  For starters, in vanilla there exists an arbitrary point at which, if your're air superiorty in an airzone exceeds it, then CAS begins to sortie and you are granted air support modifier, whilst at the same time, your enemy loses their air support bonus. On top of this, your CAS starts to deal actual strength and organization damage, as the enemy's CAS grounds. \n \n  GDU fixes this problem - CAS sorties in a much wider array of air supremacy, killing the passing back and forth between the enemy which exists in vanilla. " assuming you got atleast equal amount of fighters" CAS your enemy while also getting CAS'd  even in say 4k vs 10k planes scenario.  CAS damage has been toned down as a result of it entering battles much more often. \n  \n    \n  \n i suggest you to also read the Reverse Gangbang guide"

guides.4.t:0 "(Reverse)Gangbang effect"
guides.4.d:0 "WHY IS THE AIR RED  \n \n  Fear not! GDU you no longer get a massive air casualties, compared to your enemy , from having less planes flying in the zone  \n  \n It could even be said that gangbang is now reversed and you get very little positive K/D ratios when you use less planes "

guides.5.t:0 "Basic Division Template Tips"
guides.5.d:0 "Firstly, divisions bellow 20w are not allowed, in GDU division templates you make are far diffrent than in vanilla, due to fact that AT, ART, AA, Rifles have their attack, defence, breakthroguh, supply statistics changed a lot  \n \n  In GDU it is a must to have a single AA( one aa in gdu is 2 width) in every single division, Having AA prevents you from being over run easily , reduces effects of air superiorty  and reduces direct damage of enemy cas by 60%  \n \n  In GDU, ART, AT, AA all have good stats, and are actually either as supply efficient as infantry, or even more.  in GDU, NEVER EVER MAKE PURE INFANTRY, rifles have their stats spread among other equipment and other equipment are made cheaper while rifles are more expensive, rifles are basically some defense and HP, nothing more in GDU \n  \n  in GDU, Damage vs brk-defense is far higher than in vanilla, due to this factor, combat is bit faster , so you want to most of the time have Signals on most of your front line-- combat divisions assuming they are made to have reserves-- reinforce in important battles etc. else does not matter if you got 8  40 wdivs or 2 in a tile, a quality division will easily push them at same time \n  \n  as Last, support companies are cheaper, and you can greatly improve quality of your army by making sure all your divisions including reserves have full support companies regardless of doctrine , ( as long as ur not using them to break infra)  "

guides.6.t:0 "Air Tips for Beginners "
guides.6.d:0 "1- Transport planes are useful for providing supply to your troops in this mod , but they are expensive \n \n  2- While playing as air controller, you should put your Fighters to airfields where they will have best air coverage, over putting them to say border with enemy. \n \n  3- Make sure your air wings with aces on them are operating from best airfields \n \n  4- In GDU , you train everything faster during early game, so you may wanna due to attrition and fuel reasons train your planes early \n \n  5- There is no air gangbang, dont be afraid of trading air with your enemy \n \n  6- It is not suggested to upgrade reliablity on your planes \n \n  7- Tactical Bombers have good range, but unlike cas , they do get disrupted in gdu often, due to not having mach 2 speed \n \n  8- State AA is a hard counter to bombers in GDU \n \n  9- It is strictly suggested to have atleast 1/5 fighter to cas ratio production in gdu, since Cas can join even in red air \n \n  10- Diffrence between interception and air superiorty is , interception use 1/5 fuel, but dont provide air superiorty, but still disrupt planes as if regularly flying "

guides.7.t:0 "Naval Compositions "
guides.7.d:0 "This guide is written for beginners In gdu if you read the positioning guide, you already know that your positioning scales between 100 and 0 as your fleet size compared to enemy grows from 1.5 to 2.5 , and in gdu lower positioning is always lower damage \n \n So dont this createa permanent downsizing of fleets? Answer is no for 2 reasons, Carriers, and after being 2.5 size the enemy since your positioning cant go bellow 0,  \n \n in GDU it is must to have 4 carriers due to how strong they are, and to screen those carriers and reduce chance of them being hit by other carriers it is must to have 8-10 capitals and to screen all your 10-11 capitals from strong torpedos that are made stronger againist bbs specifically, you need screens. around 50-60 of them   \n \n Another reason why smaller fleet is not always better is simply if you use say 10 ships in a task force, sure your enemy will have 0 positioning, but if you fight 25 ships you will be at your peak, at 50 ships , well say good bye to your ships  \n \n Thats it for the composition guide, screen your carrier, screen your bb, but dont spam ships , positioning kills."

guides.8.t:0 "Naval Tips for Beginners "
guides.8.d:0 "1- In GDU a fleet going to repair is very hard to detect, so dont panic  \n \n  2-In GDU, ships retreat faster(based on speed), what this means is if you dont set your ships to never repair-always engage most of your fleet will escape damaged. \n \n 3-Convoy raider has the advantage of giving enemy a positioning debuff from defender's positioning going down due to added number of convoys \n \n 4- GDU Torpedos do double damage to capitals, but are bit weaker than in vanilla againist other ships(achieved with surface visbility-armor change)  \n \n  5- The Naval Armor damage reduction formula is (1-(piercing/armor)) \n \n 6- In GDU , carriers are powerful but it is still not suggested to have more than 4-5 in your task force \n \n 7-In GDU, CAs have added surface visbility, making them really bad, and also refits are cheap, it is suggested to even take their batteries out and use them as CLs \n \n 8- Refits are really cheap, cheapt to a degree where you make a naked ship and add equipment later for no additional cost, ( i dont like it but whatever ) \n \n 9 - You can increase amount of docks you have assigned to ship repair, split your fleet and send them to diffrent ports to repair faster \n \n 10 - Only use Carrier navs, They are undisruptable in the mod(and also vanilla i think?) unless you use bigger than 100 sized air wings which is banned"

guides.9.t:0 "Be Prepared for Beginners "
guides.9.d:0 "0- Note, all these are regular occurences in the GDU mod be prepared for ;  \n \n 1- Suez or Africa Falling, Lenningrad getting encircled and holding for months \n \n 2- Soviets Getting pushed in barb start, and holding - counter attacking winter \n \n 3- Everyone building some air, but not spamming \n \n  4- People telling you to never make HT divisions \n \n  5- Japan Taking all of DEI(its unguardable) and most of Rubber and putting up a fight in navy and land and air and USA not using fleet in first 4 months due to debuff \n \n 6- France being built around always defending mainland, and always trying to hold but not managing to hold, and getting factories based on how they held between 0 to 10 weeks for their after life tag, FRF where after tag switch they lose all equipment become a new nation , so no stupid abandon france strats \n \n 7- Actual Resource wars, and no strategical bombing cancer \n \n 8- Special places, having very special Supply designs \n \n 9-Fully dynamic fronts, and a fast game till DOW \n \n  10- Lastly everyone is a potential tank producer "
guides.9.a:0 "Thanks for the Information "

guides.10.t:0 "Extreme Summary of GDU "
guides.10.d:0 "1- GDU AIR ; State of ART Cas and Fighters, it is set so that everyone builds some air, but no matter what you do, you can not completely disrupt your enemy's CAS, and you dont trade better by just having more planes, and AA dont mass shot down cas but do a fair damge reduction, While fighters kill cas and fight fighters so Always have CAS, AA and some fighters \n \n 2- GDU LAND; AT= lose battle wins IC Trade Always,  Never pierces Tanks but do good STR damage but low org damage, AA= Must but not broken , Support companies = Super Cheap fill all slots ART=If you have no line ART, you are playing this mod very wrong, it is more supply efficient than inf and have almost same ic cost per width and good stats \n \n 3- GDU NAVY; No doomstacking, you make Carrier centered battlegroups, no single decisive battle but a sort of war of attrition, Dont forget to refit, and make naked ships, always have admiral,  "

guides.11.t:0 "Dont Do These Mistakes "
guides.11.d:0 "1-Do not go to front line with encryption research and logistics support companies,if you dont, you will kill your allies, \n \n 2- Do not attack in Eastern Front winter and Mud as Axis, due to your terrible acclimitization compared to sov and it actually mattering in the mod \n \n 3- Do not tech rush as a minor nation in this mod. in this mod ahead of time penalty is much higher Just do your industry focuses first ALWAYS \n \n 4- Do not use Tanks with no fuel, you can see if your tank has fuel by looking at barrel icon next to it in army division list. \n \n 5- Always go for the better economy law when available \n \n 6- Dont make pure infantry \n \n 7- Do not doomstack your navy , do not d-day germany-- paradrop hungary doing so gives germany total war, instead go invade italy that does not trigger it \n \n 8-Do not fight without CAS, air color do not matter much in this mod \n \n 9- Have maintenance companies and high reliablity if you are going to fight in Desert-Easternfront-Pacific, makes a massive diffrence \n \n 10- Do not forget to ask your major nation what to do, always coordinate   "
