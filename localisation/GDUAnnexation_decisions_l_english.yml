    GER_foreign_politics_desc:0 "§gOKW served as the official military general staff for the Third Reich - coordinating the efforts of the Heer, Kriegsmarine, and Luftwaffe.\n In practice, the OKW acted as Hitler`s personal military staff, translating his ideas into military orders, then issuing those orders to the three services accordingly, (OKW having little control over their carrying out.)\n However, as the war progressed, the OKW found itself exercising increasing amounts of direct command authority over military units, particularly in the West.  So much so that by 1942 the OKW held the de facto command of all German military forces in the West, while the Army High Command (Oberkommando des Heeres, OKH) exercised de facto command of the Eastern Front.  It was not until 28 April 1945 (two days before his suicide) that Hitler replaced OKH under OKW, giving OKW command of forces on the Eastern Front.§!"
