    GER_foreign_politics_desc:0 "§gOKW served as the official military general staff for the Third Reich - coordinating the efforts of the Heer, Kriegsmarine, and Luftwaffe.\n In practice, the OKW acted as Hitler`s personal military staff, translating his ideas into military orders, then issuing those orders to the three services accordingly, (OKW having little control over their carrying out.)\n However, as the war progressed, the OKW found itself exercising increasing amounts of direct command authority over military units, particularly in the West.  So much so that by 1942 the OKW held the de facto command of all German military forces in the West, while the Army High Command (Oberkommando des Heeres, OKH) exercised de facto command of the Eastern Front.  It was not until 28 April 1945 (two days before his suicide) that Hitler replaced OKH under OKW, giving OKW command of forces on the Eastern Front.§!"

Since the situation on Germany's eastern frontier has become intolerable and all political possibilities of peaceful settlement have been exhausted, I have decided upon a solution by force.\n 2. The attack on Poland will be undertaken in accordance with the preparations made for Case White, with such variations as may be necessitated by the buildup of the Army which is now virtually complete.\n The allocation of tanks and the purpose of the operation remain unchanged.\n Date of attack: 1st September, 1939.\n This time also applies to operations at Gdynia, in the Bay Of Danzig, and at the Dirschau Bridge.\n 3. In the west it is important to leave the responsibility for opening hostilities unmistakably to England and France. Minor violations of the frontier will be dealt with, for the time being, purely as local incidents.\n The assurances of neutrality given by us to Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Switzerland are to be meticulously observed.\n The western frontier of Germany will not be crossed by land at any point without my explicit orders.\n This applies also to all acts of warfare at sea or to acts which might be regarded as such.\n The defensive activity of the Air Force will be restricted for the time being to the firm repulse of enemy air attacks on the frontiers of the Reich. In taking action against individual aircraft or small formations, care will be taken to respect the frontiers of neutral countries as far as possible. Only if considerable forces of French or British bombers are employed against German territory across neutral areas will the Air Force be permitted to go into defensive action over neutral soil.\n It is particularly important that any infringement of the neutrality of other States by our western enemies be immediately reported to the High Command Of The Armed Forces.\n 4. Should England and France open hostilities against Germany, it will be the duty of the Armed Forces operating in the west, while conserving their strength as much as possible, to maintain conditions for the successful conclusion of operations against Poland. Within these limits enemy forces and war potential will be damaged as much as possible. The right to order offensive operations is reserved absolutely to me.\n The Army will occupy the West Wall and will take steps to secure it from being outflanked in the north, through the violation by the western powers of Belgian or Dutch territory. Should French forces invade Luxembourg the bridges on the frontier may be blown up.\n... -Adolf Hitler."

Should it become evident in the near future that England, and, under her influence, France also, are not disposed to bring the war to an end, I have decided, without further loss of time, to go over to the offensive.\n 2. Any further delay will not only entail the end of Belgian and perhaps of Dutch neutrality, to the advantage of the Allies; it will also increasingly strengthen the military power of the enemy, reduce the confidence of neutral nations in Germany's final victory, and make it more difficult to bring Italy into the war on our side as a full ally.\n 3. I therefore issue the following orders for the further conduct of military operations\n (a) An offensive will be planned on the northern flank of the western front, through Luxembourg, Belgium, and Holland. This offensive must be launched at the earliest possible moment and in greatest possible strength.\n (b) The purpose of this offensive will be to defeat as much as possible of the French Army and of the forces of the Allies fighting on their side, and at the same time to win as much territory as possible in Holland, Belgium, and Northern France, to serve as a base for the successful prosecution of the air and sea war against England and as a wide protective area for the economically vital Ruhr Basin.\n (c) The time of the attack will depend upon the readiness for action of the armoured and motorised units involved. These units are to be made ready with all speed. It will depend also upon the weather conditions obtaining and foreseeable at the time.\n 4. The Air Force will prevent attacks by the Anglofrench Air Forces on our Army and will give all necessary direct support to its advance. It is also important to prevent the establishment of Anglofrench air bases and the landing of British forces in Belgium and Holland.\n 5. The Navy will do everything possible, while this offensive is in progress, to afford direct or indirect support to the operations of the Army and the Air Force.\n 6. Apart from these preparations for the beginning of the offensive in the west according to plan, the Army and Air Force must be ready, at all times, in increasing strength, to meet an Anglofrench invasion of Belgium, immediately and as far forward as possible on Belgian soil, and to occupy the largest possible area of Holland in the direction of the west coast.\n 7. These preparations will be camouflaged in such a way that they appear merely to be precautionary measures made necessary by the threatening increase in the strength of the French and English forces on the frontiers between France and Luxembourg and Belgium.\n 8. I request Commanders In Chief to submit to me their detailed plans based on this Directive at the earliest moment and to keep me constantly informed of progress through the High Command Of The Armed Forces.\n -Adolf Hitler."

This build up of a focal point in the east will be limited only by the need to protect from air attack the whole combat and arsenal area which we control, and to ensure that attacks on England, and especially upon her imports, are not allowed to lapse.\n The main efforts of the Navy will continue to be directed against England even during the eastern campaign.\n In certain circumstances I shall issue orders for the deployment against Soviet Russia eight weeks before the operation is timed to begin.\n Preparations which require more time than this will be put in hand now, in so far as this has not already been done, and will be concluded by 15th May, 1941.\n It is of decisive importance that our intention to attack should not be known.\n The preparations of the High Commands will be made on the following basis:\n I. General Intention.\n The bulk of the Russian army stationed in western Russia will be destroyed by daring operations led by deeply penetrating armoured spearheads. Russian forces still capable of giving battle will be prevented from withdrawing into the depths of Russia. The enemy will then be energetically pursued and a line will be reached from which the Russian airforce can no longer attack German territory. The final objective of the operation is to erect a barrier against Asiatic Russia on the general line Volga River-Archangel. The last surviving industrial area of Russia in the Ural Mountains can then, if necessary, be eliminated by the Airforce.\n In the course of these operations the Russian Baltic Sea Fleet will quickly lose its bases and will then no longer be capable of action.\n The effective operation of the Russian airforce is to be prevented from the beginning of the attack by powerful blows.\n... I await submission of the plans of Commanders In Chief on the basis of this Directive.\n The preparations made by all branches of the Armed Forces, together with timetables, are to be reported to me through the High Command Of The Armed Forces.\n -Adolf Hitler."

The development of the situation in Scandinavia makes it necessary to prepare for the occupation of Denmark and Norway by formations of the Armed Forces (Case Weser River Exercise). This would anticipate English action against Scandinavia and the Baltic Sea, would secure our supplies of ore from Sweden, and would provide the Navy and Air Force with expanded bases for operations against England.\n The protection of the operation against action by English Naval and Air Forces will be carried out by the Navy and Air Force within the limits of existing possibilities.\n The forces employed on Case Weser River Exercise will be as small as possible having regard to our military and political strength in relation to the Northern nations. Weakness in numbers will be made good by skilful action and surprise in execution.\n The basic aim is to lend the operation the character of a peaceful occupation, designed to protect by force of arms the neutrality of the Northern countries. Demands in this sense will be made to the Governments concerned at the beginning of the occupation, and the necessary emphasis will be given, if required, by naval and air demonstrations.\n Any resistance which is nevertheless offered will be broken by all means available.\n ...3. The crossing of the Danish frontier and the landing in Norway will take place simultaneously. The operations will be prepared with the utmost possible speed. Should the enemy take the initiative against Norway, we must be able to take our own countermeasures at once.\n It is of the utmost importance that our operations should come as a surprise to the Northern countries as well as to our enemies in the west. This must be kept in mind in making all preparations, especially in the choice of dumps and embarkation points, and in the briefing and embarkation of troops. Should it become impossible to conceal preparations for embarkation, Officers and men will be given a false destination. Troops will be informed of the true objective only after putting to sea.\n 4. Occupation of Denmark (Weser River Exercise South). Task Of Group XXI: The surprise occupation of Jutland and Fünen and subsequent occupation of Zeeland.\n For this purpose troops will push through to Skagen and to the east coast of Fünen as quickly as possible, securing the most important points. Bases in Zeeland will be occupied at the earliest moment to serve as springboards for the further occupation.\n The Air Force, after the occupation, will ensure adequate air defence, as well as the exploitation of Norway as a base for the prosecution of the air war against England.\n -Adolf Hitler."

My intention is therefore:\n (a) To establish in the coming months a constantly increasing force in southern Romania.\n (b) On the arrival of favourable weather -- probably in March -- to move this force across Bulgaria to occupy the northern coast of the Aegean and, should this be necessary, the entire mainland of Greece (Undertaking Marita). We can rely upon Bulgarian support.\n 3. The build up of the forces in Romania will be as follows:\n (a) 16th Panzer Division, which arrives in December, will join the Military Mission, whose duties remain unchanged.\n (b) Subsequently a force of about seven divisions will be moved to southern Romania. Engineer forces in sufficient strength to prepare the Danube River crossings can be incorporated in the transports of 16th Panzer Division (as instruction forces). Commander In Chief Army will apply for my orders for the employment of these troops on the Danube River in due course.\n (c) Preparations should be made to transport reinforcements until the total limit of twenty four divisions intended for Undertaking Marita has been reached.\n (d) The Airforce must afford air defence for the concentration and will arrange for the necessary headquarters and supply dumps on Romanian soil.\n 4. Undertaking Marita itself will be prepared on the following basis:\n (a) The first objective of the operation is the occupation of the Aegean Sea coast and the Salonika basin. It may become necessary to pursue the attack via Larissa and the Isthmus of Corinth.\n (b) The flank of the attack will be protected against Turkey by the Bulgarian army; but German units will also be held in readiness to strengthen and support it.\n (c) It is not yet certain whether Bulgarian formations will play any other role in the attack.\n -Adolf Hitler."

Further, the extreme southern region of Yugoslavia will be cut off from the rest of the country and will be occupied as a base from which the German-Italian offensive against Greece can be continued.\n The opening of traffic on the Danube as soon as possible and the seizure of the Bor copper mines are important for economic reasons.\n Efforts will be made to induce Hungary and Bulgaria to take part in operations by offering them the prospect of regaining the Banat and Macedonia.\n Internal tensions in Yugoslavia will be encouraged by giving political assurances to the Croats.\n 3. I issue the following detailed orders:\n (a) As soon as sufficient forces are available and the weather allows, the ground installations of the Yugoslav Airforce and the city of Belgrade will be destroyed from the air by continual day and night attack.\n (b) If possible simultaneously -- but in no event earlier -- Undertaking Marita will begin, with the temporarily limited objective of occupying the Salonika Basin and gaining a foothold on the heights of Edessa.
