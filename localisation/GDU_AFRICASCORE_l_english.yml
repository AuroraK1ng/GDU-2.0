 ENG_Afrika_Purchase1:0 "Invest in Naval Invasions"
 ENG_Afrika_Purchase1_desc:0 "The Queen of the Desert has proven formidable, even against the Desert Fox; however, one cannot deny that our next fight will likely not be in the Desert...and it will likely require an Amphibious Assault to get there. Not that Africa has been a waste, we can share what we have learned here with the Soviets. We fight a common enemy after all...for now. Years later they will claim they won all by themselves, but we will know the truth."

 ENG_Afrika_Purchase2:0 "Demoralize the Axis"
 ENG_Afrika_Purchase2_desc:0 "The Queen of the Desert has proven formidable, even against the Desert Fox; so much so, in fact, that the soldiers and workers of our enemies are becoming demoralized by tales of our desert triumphs, and their desert defeats."
 
 ENG_Afrika_Purchase_tankbonus:0 "Invest in [FROM.GetName] Tank Research"
 ENG_Afrika_Purchase_tankbonus_desc:0 "Our Commonwealth Allies have fought well in Africa, often with outdated equipment. Should we share our Tank Research with [FROM.GetName] as we did the Hawker Hurricane with Canada, we can greatly improve our Alliance's capabilities in the coming battle, wherever that front may be."
 
 GER_Afrika_Purchase1:0 "Motivate the Army"
 GER_Afrika_Purchase1_desc:0 "Surprisingly, the desert battles of Afrika have taught us less about Mobile Warfare and more about Combined Arms, greatly advancing our defensive capabilities. We can share this among our Axis, though I'm sure Italy will still find a way to screw it up."

 GER_Afrika_Purchase2:0 "Demoralize the Allies"
 GER_Afrika_Purchase2_desc:0 "Our desert victories in Afrika have turned our Desert Fox into a cultural icon, whose influence is now spreading into the Allied home front. We can emphasize this in our propaganda to demoralize the enemy with tales of our continual victories and their continuous defeats. After all, if the Allies have no chance in Afrika against our modern Panzer knights, they may as well just give up and alt-f4. Of course, Italy will probably alt-f4 too."
