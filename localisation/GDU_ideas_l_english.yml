During the second phase, lasting from late 1942 until the Japanese surrender, the Allies—consisting primarily of Australian and US forces—cleared the Japanese first from Papua, then the Mandate and finally from the Dutch colony. The campaign resulted in a crushing defeat and heavy losses for the Empire of Japan. As in most Pacific War campaigns, disease and starvation claimed more Japanese lives than enemy action. Most Japanese troops never even came into contact with Allied forces, and were instead simply cut off and subjected to an effective blockade by the US Navy. Garrisons were effectively besieged and denied shipments of food and medical supplies, and as a result, some claim that 97% of Japanese deaths in this campaign were from non-combat causes."

A large number of river barges and transport ships were gathered together on the Channel coast, but with Luftwaffe losses mounting in the Battle of Britain and no sign that the Royal Navy had been defeated, Hitler postponed Sea Lion indefinitely on 17 September 1940; it was never put into action."

This idea serves as a disincentive for you to take advantage of historical foresight and pre-build refineries in advance of Japan's attack. Instead, you are incentivized to hold on to what limited natural rubber supplies you can for as long as possible, while scrambling to begin synthetic rubber production. You should expect some short-term rubber shortages.\n\nYou can get rid of this penalty and instead get a bonus to refinery construction by completing your synthetic rubber focus, which is available as soon as Japan joins the war."

Why the anger, why the rage? ¹ Our blood which we shed for you will not be blessed otherwise; For freedom is the absolute right of my God-worshiping nation. I have been free since the beginning and forever will be so. What madman shall put me in chains! I defy the very idea! I’m like the roaring flood; powerful and independent, I’ll tear apart mountains, exceed the heavens and still gush out! The lands of the West may be armored with walls of steel, But I have borders guarded by the mighty chest of a believer. Recognize your innate strength, my friend! And think: how can this fiery faith ever be killed, By that battered, single-fanged monster you call “civilization”? My friend! Leave not my homeland to the hands of villainous men! Render your chest as armor and your body as trench! Stop this disgraceful rush! For soon shall come the joyous days of divine promise… Who knows? Perhaps tomorrow? Perhaps even sooner!   View not the soil you tread on as mere earth, recognize it! And think about the shroudless thousands who lie so nobly beneath you. You’re the noble son of a martyr, take shame, hurt not your ancestor! Unhand not, even when you’re promised worlds, this paradise of a homeland. What man would not die for this heavenly piece of land? Martyrs would gush out were one to just squeeze the soil! Martyrs! May God take all my loved ones and possessions from me if He will, But may He not deprive me of my one true homeland for the world. Oh glorious God, the sole wish of my pain-stricken heart is that, No heathen’s hand should ever touch the bosom of my sacred Temples. These adhans, whose shahadahs are the foundations of my religion, And may their noble sound last loud and wide over my eternal homeland. For only then, shall my fatigued tombstone, if there is one, prostrate a thousand times in ecstasy, And tears of fiery blood shall flow out of my every wound, And my lifeless body shall gush out from the earth like an eternal spirit, Perhaps only then, shall I peacefully ascend and at long last reach the heavens. So flap and wave like the bright dawning sky, oh thou glorious crescent, So that our every last drop of blood may finally be worthy! Neither you nor my race shall ever be extinguished!

    SPA_recovering_from_civil_war2_desc:0 "Spain is allowed to technically enter the war solely for gameplay purposes - namely so that you can ping the rest of the Axis, and so that Spanish troops actually share supply (volunteers do not use supply). However, Spain should really be thought of as a volunteer country, and we do not want it to really be fully in the war. For that reason, Spain has no airfields so that they cannot be used to attack Gibraltar, the entire Spanish coast is impassable (preventing naval invasions), Spanish manpower is greatly reduced, and it is against the rules to do anything that exploits the fact that Spain is technically in the war (for example, no bombing Spain, no paradrops in or out of Spain, no attacking in/out of Spain, etc). Spain should be treated by both Axis and Allies as though it is a volunteer-only country."
